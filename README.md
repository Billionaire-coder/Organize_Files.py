File Organizer by File Type
Description
This Python script organizes files in a specified directory by their file types. It scans the directory, identifies file extensions, and moves the files into folders named after their type (e.g., .jpg files go into a jpg_files folder).

Features
Organizes files based on their extensions into dedicated folders.
Automatically creates subfolders if they do not already exist.
Ignores subdirectories and only organizes files at the root level.

Prerequisites
Python 3.x installed on your system.
